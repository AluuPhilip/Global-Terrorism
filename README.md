### Data Source 
---
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the data source is from "Kaggle dataset"
### Tools Used 
---

- Excel - Data cleaning
- Power Query: Used for validation checks, deleting rows and colunn, setting the right data types and merging of dates 
- made use of the DAx function inpower to calculate measures and field
- Power BI- Creating report
  

### Data cleaning/preparation
In the initial initial data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks
1. Data loading and inspection into Excel
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting
4. Used Dax function for calculation
5. Changed data Type to it appropriate types, like date , country, strings and numbers
6. Used Power Query for Creating calculated feilds/ Columns and remove Duplicates

### Exploratory data Analysis (EDA)
#### Analysis Questions Addressed by the Global Terrorism Dashboard
- How has the frequency of global terrorist attacks changed over time from 1970 to 2017?
- Which countries have experienced the highest number of terrorist attacks between 1970 and 2017?
- What are the most common types of targets in terrorist attacks globally?
- Which methods of attack are most commonly used in terrorist activities worldwide?
- What regions of the world have been most affected by terrorism, and what is the success rate of attacks in these regions?

### Findings 
#### Trends Over Time
The number of terrorist attacks has varied significantly over the analyzed period. Key observations include:

- 1970-2000: The early years saw moderate fluctuations with a notable peak in the early 1990s, reaching around 2,600 attacks per year.

- 2000-2010: A period of relative stability followed, with annual attacks averaging between 900 and 1,200.

- 2010-2017: There was a sharp increase in attacks, peaking at 16,900 in 2014, primarily due to the rise of ISIS and increased conflicts in the Middle East. By 2017, attacks had decreased to 10,900.

#### Geographical Distribution
The distribution of attacks by country highlights regions most affected by terrorism:

Iraq: 25,000 attacks
Pakistan: 14,000 attacks
Afghanistan: 13,000 attacks

Colombia: 8,000 attacks
- Other countries with significant numbers include the Philippines (7,000), Peru (6,000), El Salvador (5,000), the United Kingdom (5,000), and Turkey (4,000).
By region, the Middle East & North Africa (44,000 attacks) and South Asia (39,000 attacks) experienced the highest number of attacks, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (16,000), Western Europe (14,000), and Southeast Asia (11,000).

#### Attack Success Rate
The success rates of attacks also varied by region:

Middle East & North Africa: High success rate with 44,000 successful attacks.
South Asia: 39,000 successful attacks.
Sub-Saharan Africa: 16,000 successful attacks.
Western Europe: 14,000 successful attacks with a significant portion being unsuccessful.

- Less common methods included unknown tactics (7,000), unarmed assaults (1,000), barricade incidents (1,000), and hijackings (1,000). 
   
### Recommendation 

 Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made for policymakers and security agencies:

1. Enhanced Intelligence and Surveillance:
Increase intelligence operations in high-risk regions such as the Middle East, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa to preemptively identify and disrupt terrorist plots.
2. Strengthen Counter-Terrorism Efforts:
Allocate additional resources and training for military and police forces in the most affected countries to improve their ability to respond to and prevent attacks.
3. International Collaboration:
Foster international cooperation and intelligence-sharing to combat transnational terrorist networks effectively.
4. Community Engagement and Resilience:
Implement community-based programs to counter radicalization and build local resilience against extremist ideologies.
5. Protecting Vulnerable Targets:
Enhance security measures for high-frequency targets, particularly private citizens, military, police, and government entities.
6. Technological Advancements:
Invest in advanced surveillance and data analysis technologies to detect and respond to threats more swiftly and accurately.
Policy and Legislation:
Develop and enforce robust anti-terrorism laws that provide law enforcement agencies with the necessary tools to combat terrorism while ensuring civil liberties are protected.

### Conclusion
The analysis of global terrorism from 1970 to 2017 reveals significant trends and patterns in terrorist activities. By understanding these trends, policymakers and security agencies can implement targeted measures to reduce the frequency and impact of terrorist attacks. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to the evolving nature of terrorism

are essential for ensuring global security and stability. The recommendations provided aim to strengthen counter-terrorism efforts, improve intelligence and surveillance, and enhance international cooperation, ultimately contributing to a safer world.

### Limitations
- Data Gaps: Incomplete or inconsistent data for certain periods or regions.
- Reporting Bias: Variations in reporting standards and coverage across different countries and time periods.
### Future Research
- Further Analysis: Continued monitoring and analysis of post-2017 data to identify new trends.
- Impact Studies: Assessing the long-term impact of terrorism on affected communities and economies.
